# 🛍️ Customer Purchase Behavior & Revenue Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer transaction data to identify high-value segments and growth opportunities. Using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn**, I transformed raw purchase data into executive-level insights focusing on customer loyalty, regional performance, and seasonal trends.

## 🚀 Key Insights for Stakeholders
* **Loyalty ROI:** Subscribers demonstrate a significantly higher **Total Revenue Contribution** compared to non-subscribers, despite similar average transaction values.
* **Regional Health:** Identified the Top 10 Locations by spend, highlighting areas where high revenue intersects with low review ratings (service "danger zones").
* **Inventory Optimization:** A Category-vs-Size pivot analysis revealed the "Sweet Spot" for stock allocation to maximize sales.
* **Seasonal Trends:** Revenue distribution peaks during specific seasons, allowing for better-timed marketing campaigns.

## 📊 Visualizations
The analysis features "Clean & Attractive" data visualizations designed for clarity:
* **Donut Charts:** For seasonal revenue distribution.
* **Subplots:** For side-by-side comparison of Subscriber efficiency vs. scale.
* **Heatmaps:** To visualize complex Category and Location relationships.
* **Styled Pivot Tables:** Financial-grade tables with conditional formatting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** * `Pandas`: Data manipulation and aggregation
    * `Matplotlib`: Core visualization and layout control
    * `Seaborn`: Statistical heatmaps and advanced styling
